<h1>Active Directory Lab</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved the creation and management of 100 customized Windows AD user accounts to facilitate secure access and permissions. Connectivity was established between on-premises servers and cloud services, enabling seamless data synchronization. I designed and implemented organizational units across two sites, integrating a shared folder infrastructure to optimize file management. Advanced tools were utilized to enforce file screens, quotas, and enable shadow copies for effective data protection. A secure certificate infrastructure was developed, keeping the intermediate certificate server online while the root server remained offline for enhanced security. Additionally, I deployed and managed Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for centralized software updates and software deployment through Group Policy Objects (GPO).
